Useful linux notes are here.

# My use case

I use _Debian Lite_ and start installing _desktop environment (DE)_ and packages over it.
I'm still not able to build package myself.

These are the DE that i've tried:
- OpenBox
- LXDE
- LXQT (currently using)

Important roadblocks that I encountered while installing will be in this notes.
